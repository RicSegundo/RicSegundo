### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :lab_coat::earth_africa: I am a Chemical/Environmental Engineer, and for almost 10 years I did research on how to improve water treatment methods

- I am passionate about:
  - :desktop_computer: Data
  - :keyboard: Programming
  - :books: Reading 
  
- :wind_face::sunny: I am currently working at [Nispera AG](https://nispera.com) as a Data Scientist, analysing renewable assets data
- :open_book: Learning is my biggest passion and what motivates me the most! I am currently completing the Data Engineering Track at [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/) and also trying to improve on my [QlikView/QlikSense](https://www.qlik.com) skills
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardosegundo/) - I am interested in discussing anything regarding Data and ML/Deep Learning.


Most of the programming I do today is at work so I cannot share the code here, but you can check some of my early work at the [Bootcamp](https://github.com/RicSegundo/DataScienceBootcamp) repository, to find the projects I completed while studying at [Propulsion Academy](https://propulsion.academy)!

I also publish the solutions to problems I solve at [HackerRank](https://github.com/RicSegundo/HackerRank), so feel free to check if you get stuck in any of them.



### How have I performed in the recent past?
