Most of what I do today is confidential, but you can checkout some of my early work at the [Bootcamp](https://github.com/RicSegundo/DataScienceBootcamp) repository, to find all projects I did while studying at [Propulsion Academy](https://propulsion.academy)!

I also publish the solutions to the problems I solve at [HackerRank](https://github.com/RicSegundo/HackerRank), so feel free to check if you get stuck in any of these problems.
